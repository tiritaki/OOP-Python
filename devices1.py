"""To understand the meaning of classes we

have to understand the built-in __init__() function.

All classes have a function called __init__(), which is

 always executed when the class is being initiated.

 Use the __init__() function to assign values to object

 properties, or other operations that are necessary to do

 when the object is being created:"""
